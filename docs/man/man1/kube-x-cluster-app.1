.SS FAQ: Why not multiple sub-chart by umbrella chart?
.PP
SubChart cannot by default installed in another namespace than the
umbrella chart.
This is a known issue with helm and
subcharts (https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5358)
.PP
That\[cq]s why: * the unit of execution is one sub-chart by umbrella
chart * \f[V]kube-x\f[R] is a common sub-chart of all umbrella chart *
this is not one \f[V]kube-x\f[R] umbrella chart with multiple sub-charts

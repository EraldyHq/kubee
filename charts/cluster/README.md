# Kubee Cluster Chart

This `library chart` represents a `kubee cluster`.

It adds support for sharing:
* cluster values
  * name
  * nodes
* common app values such as:
  * users (admin)
  * email
  * [cloudflare](https://github.com/EraldyHq/kubee/blob/main/docs/site/cloudflare.md)
  * trusted proxies
* and a [common library of functions](templates/_helpers.tpl)

This chart is a dependency of all `Kubee charts`

## Installation

You don't install a library chart.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| auth.admin_user | object | `{"cluster_role":"cluster-admin","email":"","password":"","username":"admin"}` | The admin user  * created as admin user in Kubernetes and other app  * added in basicAuth |
| auth.trusted_proxies | list | `[]` | Trusted Proxies If trusted, reverse proxies handler will proxy and augment the sensitive X-Forwarded-* request headers.  You should set the CIDR value of: * internal proxy such as traefik * and external proxy such as cloudflare It's used by Traefik and all auth application that needs the real ip and trust the X-forward headers |
| chart | string | `"k3s-ansible"` | The cluster chart. The cluster chart is responsible for the installation/management of Kubernetes on the nodes |
| distribution | string | `"k3s"` | The kubernetes distribution k3s is the distribution that has a cluster chart implemented. |
| email.smtp | object | `{"from":"","hello":"","host":"","password":"","port":465,"username":""}` | Smtp Configuration |
| name | string | `"kubee"` | The cluster name used: * to identify the cluster (for instance, on prometheus remote-write metrics, the name is added as label) * as default first instance name for operator (for instance, prometheus operator allows to install multiple prometheus that needs to be unique. Kube-prometheus asks for a unique name) |

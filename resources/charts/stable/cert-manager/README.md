# The cert manager kubee chart

## About
This `kubee chart` will install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to manage certificate.

## Installation

### Enable and set your Email

* By default, `cert-manager` is disabled, it needs to be enabled.
* The email is used as account id by Letsencrypt and is mandatory.

In your helm values file, set the following values:

```yaml
cluster:
  auth:
    admin_user:
      email: 'foo@bar.com'
cert_manager:
  enabled: true
```

### Optional: Config Cloudflare

By default, the `http01` challenge is executed meaning 
but if you want a `dns01` on Cloudflare, you can configure it this way:

* Get the API key [Ref](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/)
  * Go to `Cloudflare > User Profile > API Tokens > API Tokens`.
  * Create a token with
  * Permissions:
     * `Zone - DNS - Edit`
     * `Zone - Zone - Read`
    * Zone Resources :
       * `Include - All Zones`
* Set the cloudflare properties in your cluster values file.
```yaml
cert_manager:
    dns01:
        cloudflare:
          # See cert-manager/README.md on how to get cloudflare api key
          cloudflareApiToken: 'token'
          # The dns Zone that are managed by cloudflare
          dnsZones:
            - my-apex-domain.tld
            - another-apex-domain.tld
```

### Deploy

```bash
kubee --cluster clusterName helmet play cert-manager
```

### Change the default issuer

By default, the certificate are issued with `letsencrypt-staging` and are [not valid](#why-my-certificates-are-not-valid).

When you have controlled that you receive certificate
* from Letsencrypt
* and not the default Traefik certificate
you should change the default issuer to `letsencrypt-prod`

Example: In your cluster values file.
```yaml
cert_manager:
  issuer_name: 'letsencrypt-prod'
```

## Features

It will create:
* [letsencrypt issuer](#letsencrypt-acme-issuers) to create external certificate (acme)
* [kubee-ca issuer](#kubee-internal-ca) to create internal service certificate (mtls)
* install the [cert-manager grafana dashboard and alerts](#dashboard-and-alerts)

### Letsencrypt Acme Issuers

2 `ClusterIssuers` are installed
* `letsencrypt-staging` for the `staging environment (test)`
* `letsencrypt-prod` for the `production environment`

The issuers solve the challenge:

* `http01` (default, ie an A or CNAME record should be present in the DNS Zone)
* and optional `DNS01` from cloudflare (if the api token and the domains are given).

The
* `letsencrypt-staging`. This is the Default used to:
    * ensure that the verification process is working properly before moving to production.
    * without hitting the [prod rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/)
* `letsencrypt-prod` issues valid signed certificate

You can check them in the CRD of the dashboard:
https://dashbord.example.com/#/customresourcedefinition/clusterissuers.cert-manager.io?namespace=cert-manager

### Kubee Internal CA

We use an internal CA to issue internal certificate
to:
* enable SSL communication internally
* issue certificate for auth service (database, oidc, ...)

### Dashboard and alerts

The [cert-manager mixin](https://monitoring.mixins.dev/cert-manager/) is installed
to create:
* [grafana dashboard](https://monitoring.mixins.dev/cert-manager/#dashboards) if the [grafana chart ](../grafana/README.md) is enabled
* [alerts](https://monitoring.mixins.dev/cert-manager/#alerts) if the [prometheus chart](../prometheus/README.md) is enabled

| enabled | bool | `false` |  |
| issuer_name | string | `"letsencrypt-staging"` |  |
| issuers.external.name | string | `"letsencrypt-staging"` | The acme issuer used in all ingress (external certificate request) of kubee It should be changed to 'letsencrypt-prod' when the letsencrypt-staging is working and validated |
| issuers.internal.name | string | `"kubee-ca"` | The acme issuer used in all ingress (external certificate request) of kubee It should be changed to 'letsencrypt-prod' when the letsencrypt-staging is working and validated |

## Support

### Why my certificates are not valid

By default, this chart is set to work with the [Let's encrypt Staging environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/).

The certificates are:
* not valid (not trusted)
* issued by:
    * Common Name (CN)	(STAGING) Counterfeit Cashew R10
    * Organization (O)	(STAGING) Let's Encrypt

# The kubee cluster chart

This chart represents a `kubee cluster`.

It adds support for:
* [cluster values](#values)
* common app values
* and a [common library of functions](templates/_helpers.tpl)

This chart is a dependency of all `Kubee charts`

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| auth.admin_user.cluster_role | string | `"cluster-admin"` | Kubernetes clusterRole * `cluster-admin` has full access * `admin` does not have access to node and cluster scope related object such as ClusterRoleBinding |
| auth.admin_user.email | string | `""` | The admin email It's used by default in apps. For instance: * letsencrypt registration email * alert notifications: prometheus, argocd |
| auth.admin_user.password | string | `""` | the admin password |
| auth.admin_user.username | string | `"admin"` | The admin user  * created as admin user in Kubernetes and other app  * added in basicAuth |
| auth.trusted_proxies | list | `[]` | Trusted Proxies If trusted, reverse_proxy handler will proxy and augment the sensitive X-Forwarded-* request headers. You should set the CIDR value of: * internal proxy such as traefik * and external proxy such as cloudflare It's used by Traefik and all auth application that needs the real ip and trust the X-forward headers |
| chart | string | `"k3s-ansible"` | The cluster chart. The cluster chart is responsible for the installation/management of Kubernetes on the nodes |
| distribution | string | `"k3s"` | The kubernetes distribution k3s is the distribution that has a cluster chart implemented. |
| email.smtp.from | string | `""` |  |
| email.smtp.hello | string | `""` |  |
| email.smtp.host | string | `""` | The smtp host if the host is not empty, smtp configuration are added for example for argocd email notifications |
| email.smtp.password | string | `""` |  |
| email.smtp.port | string | `""` | the smtp port |
| email.smtp.username | string | `""` |  |
| name | string | `"kubee"` | The cluster name used: * to identify the cluster (for instance, on prometheus remote-write metrics, the name is added as label) * as default first instance name for operator (for instance, prometheus operator allows to install multiple prometheus that needs to be unique. Kube-prometheus asks for a unique name) |

description: K3s Ansible Kubee Chart

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application because you can't use the template function with a library type
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.0.1 # The version of the chart (doesn't matter and can stay the same)

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "0.0.1" # The version of the app packaged

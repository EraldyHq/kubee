# Incubator Charts (Work In Progress)


## About

This directory contains `kubee` charts not finished (ie `WIP`, ie `Work in Progress`).

## Installation

You need to add this directory to the `KUBEE_CHARTS_PATH` env as they are not by default available.

```bash
export KUBEE_CHARTS_PATH="$HOME/code/kubee/resources/charts/incubator:$HOME/code/argocd/charts"
```
